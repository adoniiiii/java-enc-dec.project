Project: String Encryption/Decryption
Student's name, surname: Kazakbaeva Aidai
Description: It is a Java program that encrypts and decrypts text messages using cryptographic techniques.
Special algorithms I used in my project:
Caesar Cipher- a simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions.
Vigenere Cipher- a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to determine the shift for each letter, 
and each letter is shifted by a different amount based on the corresponding letter in the keyword.
Challenges: Everything was clear.
